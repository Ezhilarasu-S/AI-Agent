        "content": "In 2024, I started a marketing and research agency focused on anime and manga. I hadn't planned to...until I had already signed a few clients and pulled together a small team, but thanks to that incredible team, White Box Entertainment has helped publishers reach and understand audiences overseas. Now it's 2025! We blew past our year one goals by August, so we'll be setting our sights even higher, including more comprehensive reports, deeper dives into the mangasphere, and other novel research that I can't wait to share with all of you. Please keep an eye out for updates! This could never have happened without the foundational support of people like Rob Pereyda, Kwok-Wai H., Jerome Mazandarani, and many others. Of course, I also need to show some gratitude to the unbelievably talented folks who put up with me every day: Idy Tao, Chloe Catoya, Ariel Chan, Klaudia Amen\u00e1bar, Kayode Jaiyeola, Austin Yi, and Leah T. Thank you all for being a part of the ride, and for everyone else: please reach out if you'd like to know more about us!",

        "content": "90% of creators are not authentic. They share advice on topics they have no interest in. They share views on topics they haven\u2019t thought through. They share opinions on topics they (themselves) disagree with. They portray a false version of themselves - one they think is more worthy of love. But there remains one issue. Even if they end up attracting love, they won\u2019t be able to receive it. Because it belongs to the character, not them. The love Thor received didn\u2019t belong to Chris Hemsworth. \u279d It belongs to Thor (not the fat and drunk version). The love Sheldon received didn\u2019t belong to Jim Parsons. \u279d It belongs to Sheldon (imagine Big Bang Theory without him). The love James Bond received didn\u2019t belong to James Craig. \u279d It belongs to James Bond (childhood hero of many). If you are this person, don\u2019t feel defeated. We\u2019ve all been there and it\u2019s fine to lose yourself sometimes. But what isn\u2019t fine is staying lost and imitating people repeatedly. Be unapologetic about your beliefs and stand by them. Your fans AND your future will thank you for it. \u270d Is your content testimonials of someone else or is it YOU?

        "content": "COMMUNITY\u2026\u2026.. \ud83d\udc65 A community is nothing but a group of people that follow, understand and relate to the story and the inspiration behind the product or the brand.\ud83e\udde0 For example: A community of Sneakerheads. A community of people who like Shah Rukh Khan. And so on\u2026. So, what content actually helps you with community building?? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 Now that we already know, people in a community are ones that follow the story therefore content that speaks out the story, the inspiration behind your product is something that will attract them the most. For example: A brand named \u2018Genrage\u2019 had this T-shirt that said \u201coccult art collective\u201d and the print gave the same vibe. So, I created a piece of content that shows the tee, the occult and makes the audience know the relative story of the product.",
