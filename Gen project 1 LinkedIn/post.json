        "content": "In 2024, I started a marketing and research agency focused on anime and manga. I hadn't planned to...until I had already signed a few clients and pulled together a small team, but thanks to that incredible team, White Box Entertainment has helped publishers reach and understand audiences overseas. Now it's 2025! We blew past our year one goals by August, so we'll be setting our sights even higher, including more comprehensive reports, deeper dives into the mangasphere, and other novel research that I can't wait to share with all of you. Please keep an eye out for updates! This could never have happened without the foundational support of people like Rob Pereyda, Kwok-Wai H., Jerome Mazandarani, and many others. Of course, I also need to show some gratitude to the unbelievably talented folks who put up with me every day: Idy Tao, Chloe Catoya, Ariel Chan, Klaudia Amenábar, Kayode Jaiyeola, Austin Yi, and Leah T. Thank you all for being a part of the ride, and for everyone else: please reach out if you'd like to know more about us!"

        "title": "Authenticity in Content Creation",
        "content": "90% of creators are not authentic. They share advice on topics they have no interest in. They share views on topics they haven’t thought through. They share opinions on topics they (themselves) disagree with. They portray a false version of themselves - one they think is more worthy of love. But there remains one issue. Even if they end up attracting love, they won’t be able to receive it. Because it belongs to the character, not them. The love Thor received didn’t belong to Chris Hemsworth. ➝ It belongs to Thor (not the fat and drunk version). The love Sheldon received didn’t belong to Jim Parsons. ➝ It belongs to Sheldon (imagine Big Bang Theory without him). The love James Bond received didn’t belong to James Craig. ➝ It belongs to James Bond (childhood hero of many). If you are this person, don’t feel defeated. We’ve all been there and it’s fine to lose yourself sometimes. But what isn’t fine is staying lost and imitating people repeatedly. Be unapologetic about your beliefs and stand by them. Your fans AND your future will thank you for it. ✍ Is your content testimonials of someone else or is it YOU? Find the expanded version of this in my newsletter.

        "title": "Community Building Through Storytelling",
        "content": "COMMUNITY…….. 👥 A community is nothing but a group of people that follow, understand and relate to the story and the inspiration behind the product or the brand.🧠 For example: A community of Sneakerheads. A community of people who like Shah Rukh Khan. And so on…. So, what content actually helps you with community building?? 🤔🤔 Now that we already know, people in a community are ones that follow the story therefore content that speaks out the story, the inspiration behind your product is something that will attract them the most. For example: A brand named ‘Genrage’ had this T-shirt that said “occult art collective” and the print gave the same vibe. So, I created a piece of content that shows the tee, the occult and makes the audience know the relative story of the product."
